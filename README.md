# Raspberry Pi - Nice to have

This repository contains a collection of useful scripts for managing your Raspberry Pi.

Periodically I will add all the utilities that I use but anyone is free to contribute by creating pull requests to add new utilities.

## Scripts

- fan-non-pwm: control a non-pwm fan (on/off only) based on the temperature
